require 'logger'

	# A logger that gets bound to a vault and logs vault activity in the
	# vaults logs/ directory.
	# It's using the Ruby internal logging library to split up logs into date blocks.
	# (Each day is one log file).
	# 
	class VaultLogger

		# Sets up a logger on a vault and loads existing logs if they exist.
		# Logs are limited not in size but only by dates. Vault logs don't contain whitespaces.

		# Writes something to the current vault log (under #{@path}/logs/)
		# Possible parameters are:
		# 'debug':: Throwing every operation at the log.
		# 'info':: Default logging level for most situations and events.
		# 'warn':: Logs a warning. Should be event that won't impact stability.
		# 'error':: Logs an error. Should be recoverable event.
		# 'fatal':: Logs a fatal crash. Should make the Reepass daemon crash!
