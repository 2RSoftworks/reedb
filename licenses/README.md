The Jist of it
==============

libreedb is free software. As such, it is licensed under a free software license. We wanted libreedb to be usable in a wide variety of applications and as such we have chosen the LESSER GNU PUBLIC LICENSE as our license of choise for this project.

Summarising I can say: use libreedb in your (open and close source) projects, enjoy it and make the world a safer place. If you however apply patches to our codebase, you MUST provide them to us as well! This means that no closed source derivatives may exist of libreedb!

In addition to that libreedb is licensed with the NON MILITARY HUMANE LICENSE. This means that no entity, group or individual is allowed to use this software in a military context.

Additionally libreedb ships with a few components that have other licenses than itself. Such components include:

 - The Apache Runtime Project (Apache 2.0)
 - libprotobuf-c (BSD-2-Clause 2)
 -
