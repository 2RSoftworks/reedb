/* libreedb - config.h
 *
 * A header only file that contains definitions for config values, default
 * ranges as well as indexes that can easily be substituted into different
 * parts of the database.
 *
 * In addition to that it provides a struct that describes how a vault should
 * function after configuration. This struct is passed around different
 * parts of the library to change behaviour.
