/* libreedb - uuid.h
 *
 * A collection of utility functions around UUIDs. While uuids are their own type
 * in libreedb (struct around a fixed length array), this file contains functions
 * to create them and also return their contents as a plain char string as well
 * as the length to write into other parts of the application.
