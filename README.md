:lock: Reedb is a document oriented database that allows you to build applications that handle user data securely â€“ with whatever language you want.

It does so by encrypting all data that is stored in a database folder (callded vault) with nested symmetric ciphers provided by libgcrypt (which also powers software like GPG) which allows for multi-user access and selective sharing.

**The library is not currently deemed stable enough to use in production!**

The issue tracker has migrated to the [Lonely Robot Redmine](https://bugs.lonelyrobot.io/projects/reedb/issues).
Please also note that the Github wiki is horribly out-of-date and should generally be ignored. Please refer to the [new wiki](https://bugs.lonelyrobot.io/projects/reedb/wiki) which is currently still in the making.

Build
----------

The only way to work with Reedb at the moment is to build it from source. Clone this repository for an up-to-date copy of the codebase.

Compilation dependencies
`gcc cmake libgcrypt libmicrohttp`

An out-of-source build is recommended

```bash
mkdir build && cd build/
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

A static object of the library will be compiled as well as the `reedbd-http` extention

Install
-------

Installing Reedb to the root filesystem is currently not recommended.
Please don't do it! Thanks.
