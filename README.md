Reedb Legacy
============

This is the legacy branch of the Reedb document oriented crypto database. This code is written in Ruby, has a limited set of features but is deemed stable (enough).
It is however no longer maintained. Security issues will not be fixed and no further development will happen on this codebase.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

For a more up to date codebase please checkout the Master or even Develop branch.
