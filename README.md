#ReeDB
======

Spicy Ruby database. Json document based, low dependencies, fast and secure. Made for native app development. Protects information that is worth protecting with AES, Twofish and GnuPG/ PGP.

Proudly powering [Reepass](https://github.com/2RSoftworks/reepass) (and others).

* json, yaml and marshal files.
* AES, Twofish, OpenPGP, Sha256 and Tiger2 security.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'reedb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reedb

## Usage

```ruby
# Create a ReeDB vault by just giving it a name, specifying 
# a path, generating a key with a password and then calling
# "create". All these functions return themselves so 
# you can daisychain them into one line.

db = Reedb.vault(name='db_name', path='/my/path/')
db.keygen('super_secure_password')
db.create()

# You can either add single fields to your DB
db.insert('cool entry').data('Reedb is awesome')
db.insert('custom object').data(my_custom_object_here)

# Or create a datafile to hold thousands of fields.
db.insert(Datafile.new(name='name', category='category', url='url'))

# Force syncs data and closes the db.
# Dumps the headers into an encrypted file for the vault to pick up next time.
db.sync.close
```

Or load a vault from file
```ruby
db = Reedb.vault(path='/my/path/db_name').load('super_secure_password')
db.get('cool entry') #	=> Returns 'Reedb is awesome'
db.get('custom object') # => Returns my_custom_object_here

db.close # No force sync.
```

And much much more.
