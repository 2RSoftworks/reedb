Reedb
====

This is the newdawn branch. It is where Reedb is being rewritten to be more performant and secure.

The Ruby code will still get backports of popular features and we will try to keep the two versions as compatible as possible. However the encryption will change. Thus a migration helper will be published to help you move your 0.11.X vaults to 0.12+ vaults.

More updates on this branch as things move on.
Thanks for understanding.
